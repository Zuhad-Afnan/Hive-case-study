# Hive-case-study
With online sales gaining popularity, tech companies are exploring ways to improve their sales by analysing customer behaviour and gaining insights about product trends. Furthermore, the websites make it easier for customers to find the products they require without much scavenging. 
Therefore, as part of this case study, we will be challenging you, as a big data analyst, to extract data and gather insights from a real-life data set of an e-commerce company.
The clickstream data contains all the logs as to how you navigated through the website. It also contains other details such as time spent on every page, etc.
For this case study, you will be working with a public clickstream dataset of a cosmetics store. Using this dataset, your job is to extract valuable insights which generally data engineers come up within an e-retail company.
